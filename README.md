## 💡 Growth Ideas

### 1. 📦 Premium Packaging
**Problem:** Refurbished items often come in generic or poor packaging.

**Idea:** Add a small platform fee (e.g., 0.25%) to provide premium branded boxes, improving first impressions.

> Example: Make the unboxing feel like a new iPhone experience — boosting trust and repeat purchases.

**Idea:** 
- Launch **student discounts**
- Partner with **universities or student unions** for promotions

### 3. 🔄 Referral Program

**Idea:** Introduce a coin-based referral program where:
- A customer refers a friend → both earn coins.
- Coins are redeemable for future discounts.

> Example: Student buys a MacBook, refers a friend → earns coins → uses them to get a discount on a charger.

---

### 4. 🛍 Multi-Item Discounts

**Idea:** Encourage people to bundle purchases.

> Example: “Buy a phone and get 10% off a case or earbuds.”

---

### 5. 🎟️ Paid Membership Program

**Program Name:** Back Market Plus

**Idea:** Annual membership ($30/year) offering:
- 5% extra discounts
- Early access to deals
- Members-only offers

---

### 6. ⌚ Expand Product Categories

**Idea:** Add:
- Smartwatches & fitness bands (e.g., Apple Watch, Fitbit)
- Accessories (even if not refurbished): cables, cases, chargers

---

### 7. 🏬 Physical Experience Stores
